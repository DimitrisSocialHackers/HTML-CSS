<h2>How Do I Describe <span class="me-Myself">Myself?</span></h2>

    <p>Hello All! My name is Dimitris, I am in my 40s and I live in <em>beautiful</em> and <em>sunny</em> Athens.<br>
        I have worked in the fields of Marketing and Economics and like many Greeks at the moment I am unemployed.<br>
         I have an interest in <em>Technology</em> and have a thirst to learn how to <a target"_blanket" href="https://socialhackersacademy.org/">code</a>.<br>
          Growing up I used to listen to a group called <a href="https://www.ratm.com/" 
          alt="a photgraphic picture of a punk rock music group that was popular in the 90s">Rage Againt the Machine</a>, so I never thought I would be in this place! : ))<br>
           Growing older I found out that life is a bit crazy sometimes, so I try to make the most of my time and adapt to change.<br>
            Last, I like <a target"_blanket" href="http://www.runningnews.gr/" alt="a greek website about running">running</a>, going to art museums and cooking.<br>
